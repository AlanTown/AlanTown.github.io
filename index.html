<h1>Alan Townsend's Website</h1>
<p>Welcome to my personal website! It isn't anything special at the moment but I plan on expanding and evolving it through my college 
career. For now it is mostly about me, my hobbies and interests however I do plan on adding a resume and other items as my experience grows.</p>

<h2>A Bit About Myself</h2>
<p>At the time of making this website I am 18 years old and a <B>computer science <I>intended major</I></B>. 
I'll be completely honest here, I am a <B>huge</B> geek when it comes to a number of things. A few examples include history, space and technology.
There are actually pretty specific reasons why I'm so interested in this kinda stuff. There are two reasons why I love to learn about history.
First I am a firm believer that history has patterns and that watching these patterns can serve as hints at what's to come.
The second reason is simply that human history is the best story ever writen. I adore reading about anything from the <B><font color= DD1F1F>Roman Legions</font></B> to the world's dangerous <B><font color= A77044>first steps</B></font> in to the modern world
because you can't make some of these stories up. Now moving on to space. Put very simply I see space as the only possible solution to human growth and survival.
Our <B><font color= 6DD5F5>fragile blue marble</font></B> won't be around forever and we need to move on if our species is to survive.
It also helps that I'm a huge <B><font color= FDF000>science fiction</font></B> nerd and would love to see some of the ideas in reality. Finaly lets look at tech.
The ideas of that are starting to creep their ways into the hands of the public absolutely blow my mind. <B><font color= 28E22D>VR, Self-Driving Cars, and AI</B></font> for example interest me to no end.
Honestly part of the reason why I want to be a CS major is to be part of this kind of technology and it's development.</p>
